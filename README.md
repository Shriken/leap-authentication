Leap Authentication
===================

Research into the field of biometrics through the use of the Leap Motion controller to record the user's hand gestures,
and a combination of machine learning and biometric techniques to authenticate the user.

The end result should look something like the following.

1. The user decides on a gesture.
2. The user records that gesture a few times.
3. The user performs the gesture and is logged in.
4. Another user performs the same gesture, and is rejected based on differing movement patterns.
